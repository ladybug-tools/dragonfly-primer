Deconstruct any Dragonfly geometry object into its unique constituent Dragonfly objects. 

This is useful for editing auto-generated child objects separately from their parent. For example, if you want to assign all of the ground floors of a given auto-generated Building to have a Retail ProgramType, this can give you all of such Stories. Then you can assign a Retail ProgramType to them and combine them with the other Stories into a new Building. 



#### Inputs
* ##### df_obj [Required]
A Dragonfly Building, Story or Room2D to be deconstructed into its constituent objects. Note that, Room2Ds do not have sub-objects assigned to them and the original object will be output. 

#### Outputs
* ##### stories
The unique Story objects that make up the input _df_obj. This includes unique Stories that make up input Buildings as well as any input orphaned Stories. 
* ##### room2ds
The unique Room2D objects that make up the input _df_obj. This includes any unique Room2Ds assigned to input Stories or Buildings as well as any input orphaned Room2Ds.
