Create Dragonfly Buildings from footprint geometry (horizontal Rhino surfaces). 



#### Inputs
* ##### footprint_geo [Required]
A list of horizontal Rhino surfaces to be converted into Buildings. 
* ##### floor_to_floor [Required]
A list of float values with a length equal to the number of stories in each Building. Each value in the list represents the floor_to_floor height of the Story starting from the first floor and then moving to the top floor. 
* ##### perim_offset 
An optional positive number that will be used to offset the perimeter of the footprint to create core/perimeter Rooms. If this value is None or 0, no offset will occur and each floor plate will be represented with a single Room2D. 
* ##### name 
Text to set the base name for the Building, which will also be incorporated into unique Building identifier. This will be combined with the index of each input _footprint_geo to yield a unique name for each output Building. If the name is not provided, a random one will be assigned. 
* ##### program 
Text for the program of the Buildings (to be looked up in the ProgramType library) such as that output from the "HB List Programs" component. This can also be a custom ProgramType object. If no program is input here, the Buildings will have a generic office program. 
* ##### constr_set 
Text for the construction set of the Buildings, which is used to assign all default energy constructions needed to create an energy model. Text should refer to a ConstructionSet within the library such as that output from the "HB List Construction Sets" component. This can also be a custom ConstructionSet object. If nothing is input here, the Buildings will have a generic construction set that is not sensitive to the Buildings's climate or building energy code. 
* ##### conditioned 
Boolean to note whether the Buildings have heating and cooling systems. 
* ##### run [Required]
Set to True to run the component and create Dragonfly Buildings. 

#### Outputs
* ##### report
Reports, errors, warnings, etc. 
* ##### buildings
Dragonfly buildings.
