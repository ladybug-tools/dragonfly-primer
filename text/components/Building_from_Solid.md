Create Dragonfly Buildings from solid geometry (closed Rhino polysurfaces). 



#### Inputs
* ##### bldg_geo [Required]
A list of closed Rhino polysurfaces to be converted into Buildings. 
* ##### floor_to_floor [Required]
An array of floor-to-floor height instructions that describe how a building mass should be divided into floors. The array should run from bottom floor to top floor. Each item in the array can be either a single number for the floor-to-floor height or a text string that codes for how many floors of each height should be generated.  For example, inputting "2@4" will make two floors with a height of 4 units. Simply inputting "@3" will make all floors at 3 units.  Putting in sequential arrays of these text strings will divide up floors accordingly.  For example, the list ["1@5", "2@4", "@3"]  will make a ground floor of 5 units, two floors above that at 4 units and all remaining floors at 3 units. 
* ##### perim_offset 
An optional positive number that will be used to offset the perimeter of the footprint to create core/perimeter Rooms. If this value is None or 0, no offset will occur and each floor plate will be represented with a single Room2D. 
* ##### name 
Text to set the base name for the Building, which will also be incorporated into unique Building identifier. This will be combined with the index of each input _bldg_geo to yield a unique name for each output Building. If the name is not provided, a random one will be assigned. 
* ##### program 
Text for the program of the Buildings (to be looked up in the ProgramType library) such as that output from the "HB List Programs" component. This can also be a custom ProgramType object. If no program is input here, the Buildings will have a generic office program. 
* ##### constr_set 
Text for the construction set of the Buildings, which is used to assign all default energy constructions needed to create an energy model. Text should refer to a ConstructionSet within the library such as that output from the "HB List Construction Sets" component. This can also be a custom ConstructionSet object. If nothing is input here, the Buildings will have a generic construction set that is not sensitive to the Buildings's climate or building energy code. 
* ##### conditioned 
Boolean to note whether the Buildings have heating and cooling systems. 
* ##### run [Required]
Set to True to run the component and create Dragonfly Buildings. 

#### Outputs
* ##### report
Reports, errors, warnings, etc. 
* ##### buildings
Dragonfly buildings.
