Edit the properties of a Dragonfly Model that affect simulation with to the Urban Weather Generator (UWG). 



#### Inputs
* ##### model [Required]
A Dragonfly Model which is to have its Urban Weather Generator (UWG) properties assigned. 
* ##### terrain 
A Terrain object that dictates the properties of the street and ground beneath the buildings. If None, a default terrain object will be generated by analysing all of the buildings in the Model and drawing a bounding rectangle in the XY plane around them. 
* ##### traffic 
A TrafficPararameter object that defines the activity and intensity of traffic within the urban street canyons. If None, traffic intensity will be approximated using the average building story count along with a generic traffic schedule. 
* ##### tree_cover 
A number from 0 to 1 that defines the fraction of the exposed terrain covered by trees. If None, it will be determined by evaluating the horizontal area of all ContextShade geometry that has a true is_vegetation property. 
* ##### grass_cover 
A number from 0 to 1 that defines the fraction of the exposed terrain that is covered by grass or shrubs. If None, no grass will be assumed for the urban area. 

#### Outputs
* ##### report
... 
* ##### model
The input Dragonfly Model with its UWG properties re-assigned based on the input.
