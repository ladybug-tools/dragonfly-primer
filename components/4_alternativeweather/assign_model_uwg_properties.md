Edit the properties of a Dragonfly Model that affect simulation with to the Urban Weather Generator \(UWG\).

## Inputs

* **model \[Required\]**

  A Dragonfly Model which is to have its Urban Weather Generator \(UWG\) properties assigned. 

* **terrain**

  A Terrain object that dictates the properties of the street and ground beneath the buildings. If None, a default terrain object will be generated by analysing all of the buildings in the Model and drawing a bounding rectangle in the XY plane around them. 

* **traffic**

  A TrafficPararameter object that defines the activity and intensity of traffic within the urban street canyons. If None, traffic intensity will be approximated using the average building story count along with a generic traffic schedule. 

* **tree\_cover**

  A number from 0 to 1 that defines the fraction of the exposed terrain covered by trees. If None, it will be determined by evaluating the horizontal area of all ContextShade geometry that has a true is\_vegetation property. 

* **grass\_cover**

  A number from 0 to 1 that defines the fraction of the exposed terrain that is covered by grass or shrubs. If None, no grass will be assumed for the urban area. 

## Outputs

* **report**

  ... 

* **model**

  The input Dragonfly Model with its UWG properties re-assigned based on the input.
